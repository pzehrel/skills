# Rustdoc comment examples (`//!` and `///`)

Use `//!` for a crate or module header and `///` for items and fields, including private ones that carry
an invariant. Describe parameters in `# Arguments`, failures in `# Errors`, and panics in `# Panics` when
the function can panic.

`///` is the form rustdoc and editor hover read; a `//` comment is not surfaced by either.

In bilingual mode every comment below holds the complete English block, one blank line, and the complete
localized block, so the multi-line shape is inherent to that mode. Do not copy the shape into monolingual
mode: there the single-line `///` is the default, and consecutive-line blocks are reserved for genuinely
complex explanations.

Form follows role. `///` documents an item, and rustdoc plus editor hover read it. Inside a function body
it documents nothing: rustc reports `unused doc comment` for `///` on a statement and suggests `//`, which
is the form every in-body note below uses.

```rust
//! Persists delivery receipts together with the retry state that produced them.
//!
//! 持久化投递回执，以及产生这些回执的重试状态。

use std::time::Duration;

/// Retry limits applied to one queue.
///
/// 应用于单个队列的重试限制。
pub struct RetryConfig {
    /// Maximum attempts per item, including the first.
    ///
    /// 每个条目的最大尝试次数（含首次）。
    pub max_attempts: u8,
    /// Backoff unit; attempt `n` waits `base * 2^(n-1)` before running.
    ///
    /// 退避基数；第 `n` 次尝试开始前等待 `base * 2^(n-1)`。
    pub base_delay: Duration,
    /// Fraction of the delay that is randomized, so replicas do not retry in lockstep.
    ///
    /// 延迟中被随机化的比例，避免各副本同步重试。
    pub jitter_ratio: f32,
    /// Status codes that are retried; every other failure is returned unchanged.
    ///
    /// 需要重试的状态码；其他失败按原样返回。
    pub retry_on: Vec<u16>,
}

/// Stores one receipt and returns the row id assigned by the database.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `receipt` — Written verbatim; redaction is the caller's responsibility.
/// * `config` — Attempt limit consulted before the insert, not after a failure.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns [`StoreError::Conflict`] when the receipt id already exists; that case is not retried.
/// Returns [`StoreError::Unavailable`] for a transient connection failure, which the caller may retry.
///
/// 存储一条回执，并返回数据库分配的行 id。
///
/// 参数：
/// * `receipt`：按原样写入；脱敏由调用方负责。
/// * `config`：在插入前查询的尝试上限，而不是失败之后再查询。
///
/// 错误：回执 id 已存在时返回 [`StoreError::Conflict`]，该情况不重试；
/// 瞬时连接失败返回 [`StoreError::Unavailable`]，调用方可以重试。
pub fn store(receipt: &Receipt, config: &RetryConfig) -> Result<RowId, StoreError> {
    // Truncate before hashing: the id must stay stable when producers differ in trailing
    // newlines, otherwise the same receipt is stored twice.
    //
    // 先截断再哈希：不同生产者的结尾换行不同时 id 必须保持稳定，
    // 否则同一条回执会被存储两次。
    let normalized = receipt.body.trim_end();
    // ...
}
```

`RetryConfig` has four fields and four `///` comments. The struct comment describes the container and does
not cover any individual field.

## Enum and constant members

Every variant of a consumer-visible enum carries its own `///`, for the same reason a struct field does:

```rust
/// Outcome the retry policy returns.
///
/// 重试策略返回的结果。
pub enum RetryDecision {
    /// Another attempt is allowed; wait for the returned duration before running it.
    ///
    /// 允许再试一次；运行前等待返回的时长。
    Retry,
    /// The failure is permanent and must reach the caller unchanged.
    ///
    /// 失败是永久的，必须按原样上报调用方。
    GiveUp,
}
```

## Monolingual mode

When `AGENTS.md` is silent, write one language only; every field still gets its own comment, and one line
is the default form. A comment does not become complex just because it carries a unit, a default, or a
second clause—`/// Expiry as Unix seconds; 0 means a session cookie.` stays on one line:

```rust
/// Retry limits applied to one queue.
pub struct RetryConfig {
    /// Maximum attempts per item, including the first.
    pub max_attempts: u8,
    /// Fraction of the delay that is randomized, so replicas do not retry in lockstep.
    pub jitter_ratio: f32,
}
```

Expand to consecutive `///` lines only when the explanation is genuinely complex—several distinct facts
that read better as separate paragraphs, `# Arguments`-style sections, or an example.

## Do not write

The comment is monolingual and simple; splitting it into a summary line plus a detail paragraph imposes
structure the content does not have. Write `/// Expiry as Unix seconds; 0 means a session cookie.` on one
line:

```rust
pub struct SessionCookie {
    /// Expiry as Unix seconds.
    ///
    /// `0` means a session cookie.
    pub expires: i64,
}
```

Only the first field is described, so the second is uncovered:

```rust
/// Retry limits applied to one queue.
pub struct RetryConfig {
    /// Maximum attempts per item, including the first.
    pub max_attempts: u8,
    pub jitter_ratio: f32,
}
```

A `//` note inside a body is the correct form, but a documented field needs `///`; `//` on a field reaches neither rustdoc nor editor hover:

```rust
pub struct UploadLimits {
    // per-request ceiling in bytes
    pub chunk_size_bytes: u64,
}
```

The comment only restates the signature, so a reviewer learns nothing:

```rust
/// Returns the id.
pub fn id(&self) -> RowId { self.id }
```

The comment is a changelog; the file header is not a history log:

```rust
/// v1.2.0 (2024-03-11): switched to exponential backoff.
pub fn store(receipt: &Receipt) -> Result<RowId, StoreError> { /* ... */ }
```
